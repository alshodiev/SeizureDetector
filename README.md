## An Interpretable Model for Predicting Seizures Using EEG Data


The code analyzes EEG Data of patients and models the data using Deep learning. The code predicts when the seizure will occur as well as how long it will last.
To see the code, open Test_Run.py. 

In the process, an RNN model has been used to predict and identify seizures,predict how long the seizure will last, and investigate how the RNN is making decision about seizure occurrence and seizure length. 

NOTE: EEG Data of patients has been obtained from a private database by Temple University EEG Corpus
